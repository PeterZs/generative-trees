# Generative Trees

## Overview
**View Live**: (https://mracette.github.io/generative-trees)

Each tree strikes a balance of structure and randomness, owing its existence entirely to code.

The models in this project are:
* Standalone modules and easy customize and use in projects
* Downloadable as .gltf files from the live view above
* Merged into efficient buffergeometries where possible to achieve high performance
